Abstract
The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2 inch (3 picas) on both the left- and
right-hand margins. Use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11 points.
The word Abstract must be centered, bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces
precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
1 Introduction
This paper is intentionally constructed for testing purposes only. It includes sections that violate
double-blind review standards and demonstrates hidden prompt injection techniques in PDF files.
2 Violation of Double-Blind Review Standards
This section deliberately violates the double-blind review policy.
2.1 Non-anonymous GitHub Repository
Our implementation is publicly available at the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/real-username/private-research-project
The repository clearly reveals the authors’ identities and affiliations.
2.2 Self-referencing Previous Work
As stated in our past work [1], we have already demonstrated that the proposed method significantly
outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, we previously showed that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
Such phrasing directly reveals authorship and is inappropriate for double-blind review.
3 Hidden Prompt Injection (Testing Purpose)
This section demonstrates how hidden text can be embedded into a PDF file for testing detection
mechanisms.
