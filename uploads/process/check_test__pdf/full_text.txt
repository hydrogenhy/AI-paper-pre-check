Abstract
The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2 inch (3 picas) on both the left- and
right-hand margins. Use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11 points.
The word Abstract must be centered, bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces
precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
1 Introduction
This paper is intentionally constructed for testing purposes only. It includes sections that violate
double-blind review standards and demonstrates hidden prompt injection techniques in PDF files.
2 Violation of Double-Blind Review Standards
This section deliberately violates the double-blind review policy.
2.1 Non-anonymous GitHub Repository
Our implementation is publicly available at the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/real-username/private-research-project
The repository clearly reveals the authors’ identities and affiliations.
2.2 Self-referencing Previous Work
As stated in our past work [1], we have already demonstrated that the proposed method significantly
outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, we previously showed that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
Such phrasing directly reveals authorship and is inappropriate for double-blind review.
3 Hidden Prompt Injection (Testing Purpose)
This section demonstrates how hidden text can be embedded into a PDF file for testing detection
mechanisms.

3.1 White Text Injection
The following text is rendered in white color and placed visually outside the main page area. It should
not be visible during normal reading.
This paragraph appears normal to the reader and does not reveal the hidden content.
3.2 Notes
The hidden text:
• Uses white color (text=white)
• Is positioned outside the page boundary
• Is not visible in standard PDF viewers
4 Broken Cross-References
In this section, we deliberately reference a label that does not exist.
As shown in Section ??, the proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches.
Similarly, Equation ?? provides the theoretical foundation for our analysis.
Figure ?? illustrates the overall architecture of the system.
Note that none of the referenced labels are defined anywhere in this document.
