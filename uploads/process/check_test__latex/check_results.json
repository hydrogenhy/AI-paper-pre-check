The most critical problems are severe anonymity violations and confirmed attempts at prompt injection.\n\nMajor double-blind review risks are present. The author's name, institution, and email are directly included in the manuscript. Furthermore, the text contains explicit self-references to the authors' past work and a direct link to a non-anonymous GitHub repository, which together would immediately reveal the authors' identities to reviewers. To comply with double-blind policy, you must remove all author and institutional identifiers from the manuscript, including the author block and any affiliations in the text. Replace self-referential phrases like \"our past work\" or \"we previously showed\" with neutral language, such as \"prior work has shown.\" The GitHub link must point to an anonymized repository or be removed entirely.\n\nAdditional issues require attention. The manuscript includes a direct instruction to ignore review instructions and hidden white text, which constitutes a serious policy violation and must be deleted completely. There are also unresolved cross-references to non-existent equations, figures, and sections that should be corrected for clarity. Finally, consider checking the resolution of the included image to ensure it is suitable for publication."
