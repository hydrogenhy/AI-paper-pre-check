\section{Violation of Double-Blind Review Standards}

This section deliberately violates the double-blind review policy.

\subsection{Non-anonymous GitHub Repository}

Our implementation is publicly available at the following GitHub repository:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/real-username/private-research-project}
\end{center}

The repository clearly reveals the authors' identities and affiliations.

\subsection{Self-referencing Previous Work}

As stated in our past work~\cite{our_previous_work}, we have already demonstrated that the proposed
method significantly outperforms existing approaches.
Specifically, \emph{we previously showed} that this framework achieves state-of-the-art
results on multiple benchmarks.

Such phrasing directly reveals authorship and is inappropriate for double-blind review.
