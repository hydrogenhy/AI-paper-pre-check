\section{Broken Cross-References}

In this section, we deliberately reference a label that does not exist.

As shown in Section~\ref{sec:nonexistent_section}, the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches.

Similarly, Equation~\ref{eq:missing_equation} provides the theoretical foundation
for our analysis.

Figure~\ref{fig:ghost_figure} illustrates the overall architecture of the system.

Note that none of the referenced labels are defined anywhere in this document.
